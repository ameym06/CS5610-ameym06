Sound Bytes is my project under the course Web Developemnt (CS-5610) that I took during my graduation. 
This web application serves for Guest as well as Registered users. 
Both, guest and registered users can listen to music, watch youtube videos, find live concerts. 
The registered Users get the priviledge of writing blogs and viewing their blogs anytime they want. 

Please visit: http://soundbytes-openshifteramey6.rhcloud.com/ to give it a try!
