This week I continued experimenting on JQuery. I believe, this will be my last week for JQuery <br>
Uptil now I learnt about JQuery events, selectors, etc. This week, I learnt about JQuery Sliders, Iterators, etc<br>
I implemented a sliders and also worked on JQuery AJAX to fetch movie details<br>
Although I have brief knowledge about BootStrap, I shall still experiment on Bootstrap (and its features) in the next week <br />
<br>
The experiments for the week can be found here
