This week I continued experimenting on JQuery alongwith JQueryUI, <br>
I worked with JQuery selectors, then advanced to experiments on jquery-fade-in fade-out events<br>
This week, I also implemented an autocomplete feature-experiment that would autocomplete the name of States based on Initial letters<br>
Next week I will continue working on JQuery as I am starting to develop a keen interest in it <br />
<br>
The experiments for the week can be found here
