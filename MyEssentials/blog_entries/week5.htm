This week I started working on BootStrap <br>
I experimented on various features of the Bootstrap such as alerts styles, Menu-tabs, well, etc<br>
Since I have also started to learn AngularJS, it will be fun to experiment with AngularJS and Bootstrap together<br>
I will start experimenting on AngularJS from next week!<br />
<br>
The experiments for the week can be found here
