        <h3>My Blogs Services</h3>
        <p>
            My Blogs services are designed using Angular.JS at client end and Node.JS and MongoDB at server end.
            <ol>
                <li>My Blogs Service - Allows the logged in user to view all their blogs as a list.
                During the page load, AngularJS requests makes GET request to the NodeJS for all the blogs of the particular user.
                NodeJS fetches the data from MongoDB and replies back with appropriate content. AngularJS then renders the content onto the web page.
                </li>
            </ol>
