        <h1>Future Scope of the Project</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
            The sole purpose of this implementing this project was <b>LEARNING</b>. My aim during the implementation was to cover as many topics (that I learned in class) as possible. I stuck with the MEAN Stack web application. It is only after the completion of the project, that we can think of its future scope.
            After the completion of project, I realized that this project can be enhanced in following ways :
            <ul>
                <li>The Music and Videos services related data can be made persistent. Meaning, the users could save their favorite songs / videos</li>
                <li>The 'My Blogs' page could be enhanced into 'My Profile' page wherein the users could also see their favorite songs / videos</li>
                <li>The Users could view other users' favorite lists and share / recommend related music / videos based on genres and channels resp. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            I would definitely like to enhance my project and implement all the above functionality.
