            This is the end of Web Development Course.
            <br />
            <br />
            During the course I learned many cutting edge technologies like HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JavaScript, AngularJS, ASP.net, C# and most important NodeJS and MongoDB.
            <br />
            <br />
            I would definitely like to thank Prof. Jose Annunziato for teaching me these technolgies and increasing my skill set to a great extent. Special thanks for uploading the video lectures. Those were of great help as they allowed me to revisit the actual lectures! I would also like to thank Prof. Richard Rasala for 
            this wonderful course. Since the very beginning of the course, I have referred to Prof. Jose's and Prof. Rasala's website for help and guidance.
            <br />
            <br />
            I would also like to thank my TA Rishi Katyal for solving my queries and weekly reviewing my work and also allowing minor extensions when I needed the most. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Beside this, other resources used in learning were Google, MSDN, StackOverflow, W3Schools, Youtube API Documentation, SoundCloud API Documentation, Eventful API documentation, LastFM documentation.
            <br />
