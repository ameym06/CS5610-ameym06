    <h3>Example1:</h3>
    <div>
        In this experiment, we are going to experiment with "ng-init" directive of Angular JS.
        We will define an "ng-init" directive to store the value of username.

        This value is hard coded into the variable and printed as it is
        <div ng-init="firstName='Smith'">

            <p>The name is <span ng-bind="firstName"></span></p>

        </div>

    </div>
    <h3>Example2:</h3>
    <div ng-controller="name">
        The same can be done by encoding the data into the "double {}" that start with "{{" <br />
        and end with "}}"
        In this case we need to do some additional coding for calling a script functions.
        We do this with the use of 'ng-controller', here the controller calls the respective function and we
        can then print the value of the variable with the '$scope'. 
        <p>The name is: {{firstname}}</p>
        <script>
            function name($scope) {
                $scope.firstname = "Smith"
            }
        </script>
    </div>
    <h2>Code Documentation</h2>
    <code>
         function name($scope) { <br />
                $scope.firstname = "Smith"<br />
            }<br />
    </code>
