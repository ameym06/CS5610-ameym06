    <pre>
A "Well" is a container <code class="alert-info">div</code> that causes the content to appear sunken or an inset effect on the page. 
To create a "Well", simply wrap the content that you would like to appear in the "Well" with a <code class="alert-info">div</code> 
containing the class of .well. The following example shows a default well:

    <h4>Default Well</h4>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <div class="well">
                    Hi, i am in a simple Default well.
